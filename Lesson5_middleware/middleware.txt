middleware : anything that runs in between the request
that is sent and the response that is received 

app.get is also basically a middleware that runs only for get requests

Order of middleware is very important

app.use will be fired of every request depending on its position

Use of middleware:
Logging middleware
Authentication check middleware
Middleware to parse JSON data from requests
Return 404 pages

Express doesn't know how to move on after app.use so use 'next' function

Some third party middlwares: morgan for logging

middleware for public or static files: app.use(express.static('<folder name>'))

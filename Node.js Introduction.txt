Javascript was made for interactivity.
Node allows us to run javascript on server.
Computers can not directly run javascript. They need to convert it to machine code.

But we can run it in browser. How ?
Inside a browser, there is V8 engine (written in C++ by google) that compiles js to machine code at runtime.
So we can run javascript inside the browser.

Node.js is also written in C++. It wraps V8 engine. So node.js can run on our computer and it can compile our js into machine code.
So it can help us run code in servers. Node not only wraps V8, it provides other features as well:
Read and write files on a computer.
Connect to database.
Act as a server for content.


Use node <filename> to run the javascript file.
